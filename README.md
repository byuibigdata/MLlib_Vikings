## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is the development of computers using algorithms and mathematical models to adapt and make inferences without being explicitly told 
in lines of code. 

## Popular Machine Learning Libraries

* MLlib
* TensorFlow
* Pytorch


## Why MLlib?

* It is fast
  - uses iterative computations
  
* It is really good for big data sets

* It is friendly with languages like Python, Java, Scala, and R
  - Easy to transition workflows
  
* Scaling is made simple

* Easy to understand and tweak
  - For people starting out they can use a familiar language
  - For experts it is easier to adjust the parameters of the models and code
